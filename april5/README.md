Production Assignment Due Tuesday April 5

Get information from at least one analog sensor and at least one digital sensor (switch), and use this information to control at least two LEDs, one in a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion, in some creative way, non-obvious, or delightful way.

A bad example would be a momentary switch (pushbutton) that, when pressed, turns on an LED, or a potentiometer, that when turned, controls the brightness of an LED

A good example would be a potentiometer, that when turns, causes an LED to blink your name in Morse Code, but only while you are turning the potentiometer, and a momentary switch (pushbutton) that, when pressed, causes an LED to change brightness (bonus: the speed of change is controlled by the same potentiometer)
    Document your project in README.md in a new folder april5. Include:
        Description
        Your development process
        Picture(s)
        Video (embed your video in your README.md. An example is in Ayesha's documentation of her midterm project). If the video is too large you may put it on Youtube or Vimeo and put a link in your documentation.
        Problem(s), if any
        Discoverie(s), if any
        Schematic, which may be hand drawn or computer created
    Upload your Arduino code into the same folder with the proper extension (.ino)
