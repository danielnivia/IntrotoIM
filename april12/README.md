## Assignment 7 (April 12)
### Making a Musical Instrument using Digital and Analog sensors:

### Polyphony

#### Group: Daniel, Basil, and Pranav

#### Description:
This particular assignment is inspired from the concept of polyphony in the subject of music. The objective is to use three different arduinos (of each group member) to change the speed of the melodies using the potentiometer (analog sensor), and change the notes of the music using the switch (digital sensor).

#### Overview of the Development Process:
- We played with the rythms of the example on Arduino, made several other rythms on computational media and could finalize 3 ryhthms to be used in this assignment.
- We first tried to implement the buzzer using a potentiometer, intitally using the examples of Arduino to test the circuit.
- Once we were successful on getting it to work, we played with music notes and later calculated the necessary elements for the further implementation of the program like: BPM (beats per minute).
- A delay of 1 second was added at the end of for loop to give a gap before the next sound is being played.
- We decided to play with the ````noteDuration```` by changing the value of 1 second to 2 seconds. a variable called ````tempo````.

  It was intitally:

   ````int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote]; //1000 milliseconds - 1 second````

  Changed to:

  ````int noteDuration = 2000 / noteDurations[thisNote]; //2000 milliseconds - 2 seconds````
- Using the [online beats per minute finder](https://www.beatsperminuteonline.com), we found the beats per minute for 1000 milliseconds is 184 BPM, and for 2000 milliseconds it is found to be 92 BPM.
- Using this ratio between the ones being compared, each 1 millisecond is 0.092 BPM (As 1000ms is 184BPM and 2000ms is 92BPM).
  #### Analog Sensor:
- Then we built the circuit to include a potentiometer which controls the speed of the melody.
- A variable called ````tempo```` was created to control using a mapped value between the potentiometer's pot values and the number of milliseconds.
- For this we used the ````map()```` function to map the values between 1000ms & 2000ms, and the minimum and maximum pot values 0 & 1023.
  ````tempo = map(potPosition, 0, 1023, 1000,2000);````
  #### Digital Sensor:
- We later added a push button into the circuit.
- The push button when it is clicked, changes the rythm of the melody to another one out of the three we have here in this assignment.
- Another reason why we chose exactly three rythms is for three different arduinos that we are using.
- We used ````buttonPushCounter == 0```` or ````buttonPushCounter == 1```` to articulate the action of the buzzer with respect to its rythm.

#### Things that stood out to us personally:
- I was really intrigued when Daniel taught us how to calculate beats per minute, and many other intricate stuff when it comes to just this tiny melody that we are playing here initally. I really felt music indeed is a really interesting subject.
- So to change the rythms everytime, Daniel came up with the right notes for the ````melody[]```` array and the right durations for ````noteDurations```` array. Below are the notes and durations for

  Melody 1:

  ```` // notes in the melody:
  int melody[] = {
    NOTE_E3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_F3, NOTE_E3, NOTE_B2, NOTE_D3, NOTE_C3
  };

  // note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.:
  int noteDurations[] = {
   4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
  };
  ````

  Melody 2:

  ````// notes in the melody:
  int melody[] = {
    NOTE_C4, NOTE_G3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_A3, NOTE_G3, 0, NOTE_B3, NOTE_C4
  };

  // note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.:
  int noteDurations[] = {
    4, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
  };
  ````

- The fact that it took quite a long time to calculate the right note, and then the right duration for each note made me look at the intricacy in music.

#### Problems:
- Syncing the rythms together, as all of us have to press the RESET button at once was a hassle, but once it works: WOW!
- Delaying of the switch's input as we are everything in the for loop happens in order i.e even after the swtich button state is changed, the arduino takes time to update the change as it finishes its current process first.
- Producing the rythms from the scratch - hard but indeed had a lot of fun!- Its hard to fiddle with the circuit even just to check the connections for making the schematic, as they are very crowded and our hands are too big to make the necessary changes / not to disturb any that've already been made.

#### Discoveries:
- One interesting thing we found while playing with the Arduino is that the three pairs of pins on the middle (vertically) of one end of Arduino- when any conductor touches one of those pins, the circuit resets itself for some reason. Wonder what the use of those pins exactly are.

#### Final Outcome:

#### References and Inspiration:
Arduino to Max/Msp: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDtsSHU2UM)- Inspired that we can change the speeds using knobs, in our case, the potentiometers.
