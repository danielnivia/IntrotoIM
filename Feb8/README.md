This project was harder to begin with as I was not sure how to approach it. Nonetheless after reviewing some videos from The Coding Train, specifically: 
  - [2.4: random() Function - p5.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn4cZ0jL-o&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=11)
  - [4.2: Nested Loops - p5.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c1_TMdf8b8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=20)
  - [5.2: Function Parameters and Arguments - p5.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkc417YapfE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=22) 

it gave me inspiration for the idea I had in mind. I was planning to do a series of shapes from ellipse, squares and triangles from one corner to another, at the end of the opposite corner I was thinking to do something with lines. Thinking about using the random() function will prove to be important for changing the color, the size and the stroke weight. Below it is a sketch I did on the iPad
