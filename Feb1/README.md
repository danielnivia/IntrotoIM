## (Here should go documentation and screenshot of potrait)
### Make a self-portrait using p5.js.
- The portrait must be **entirely created by your code** i.e. you must not
	interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no
	drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait **does not need to be dynamic** (i.e. it does not need to change
	while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using
	the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a **new folder named** `Feb1`
	- Upload your *program into the new folder, with the extension* `.js`.
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a **screenshot of your portrait into the new folder** (Feb1)
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and **include your screenshot in the**
		`README.md`.
	- Also in the `README.md`, **describe any difficulties** you had or anything
		interesting you discovered.
- Post your self portrait to our **Discord channel**

Jan 28:
I worked on understanding the function [rotate()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rotate), the reference page was not as useful because the rotations seemed to be random despite converting degrees to radians. Therefore, I used The Coding Train's series on transformations, particularly [Transformations Pt.1 (Translate, Rotate, Push/Pop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM). Through this I understood the role that the function [translate()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/translate), and I managed to do a simple animation of an ellipse rotating around a specific point. 

Even though the assignment does not require animation, understanding how `rotate()` works is useful to do shapes that are at a particular angle. For this I have already branched my main repository to do experiments on the file `potrait.js`. I hope to further explore and start developing the self potrait with diverse elements.

Below is a screenshot of the result up to this point:
