### Pairs Exercises Arduino and p5js

For this week's assignment I worked with my partner on the following exercises:

- make something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5
- make something that controls the LED brightness from p5
- take the gravity wind example and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor

// Arduino code for each exercise
// Link to your sketch on p5js.org
// README.md with a video of the LED lighting up with the ball bouncing
