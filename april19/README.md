### Pairs Exercises Arduino and p5js

For this week's assignment I worked with my partner on the following exercises:

- make something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5
- make something that controls the LED brightness from p5
- take the gravity wind example and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor

Here are the links for each of the exercises README files. Each exercise presented different challenges and helped understand more how the integration of Arduino and p5js work. Now I feel more confident using the distinct applications of these two programs together.

[Exercise 2: Controlling LED arduino brightnes from p5js canvas](https://github.com/danielnivia/IntrotoIM/blob/main/april19/exercise2/README.md)

[Exercise 3: Gravity Wind example, when the ball touches the ground LED turns on and the wind moves the ball through a potentiometer](https://github.com/danielnivia/IntrotoIM/blob/main/april19/exercise3/README.md)
