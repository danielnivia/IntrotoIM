## Bicep Switch

For this assignment of creating an unusual switch I decided to implement the bicep switch. Initially I struggle trying to find a way to do an usual switch without the use of the hands. While thinking about the binary relationship of a switch: on/off; true/false; 1/0 and other, I thought a way in which this action could occur. 

Therefore, after participating in the "Last Workout" with NYUAD athletics last night most of my body is sore because of Bryan Waterman tabata burpees and Kaisa Pedersen boxing session I decided to use my sore biceps to create a switch. The concept was simple, but also a little challenging to connect the ends of the cables to turn on the LED. When I flex my bicep the two cables with copper tape will conduct electricity and therefore turn on the LED.

After adjusting the copper tape to my skin in the correct position so that both cables made contact I managed to create the switch. Below I share a video showing the switch working and the photo of the circuit itself.

Other ideas that came to mind after creating this switch like to use my foot, steping on a surface or lifting my foot. I am excited to see how other people came with unusual ways to make a switch.
