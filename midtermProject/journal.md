### Midterm Project

The following markdown file hopes to explain the initial concept for my Midterm Project, in addition discuss the riskiest or most complicated element in the program.

#### Concept of the project

My initial idea for the project is similar to pong game. However, there are some key differences. For example it will be one player rather than two, and instead of a horizontal view it will be vertical. The idea is to maintain a ball (and/or balls) not falling to the ground. Initially the user begins with one ball and as he is able to increase in points other balls starrt falling. There might be other elements that fall that may cause the user to loose, so he must be careful not to grab these elements. 

As I researched a little more this idea is relatively similar to the Atari game Breakout in which the direction of the paddle and the ball is vertical, but breaks a wall. I could maybe fuse these two ideas into one, adding to the difficulty of dealing with multiple balls and different falling objects. 

#### Most complicated element

I believe the hardest element to implement will be the motion of the ball bouncing. I am expecting to apply some motion physics to the movement of the ball after bouncing on the paddle, like a parabola. Maybe this might not be the ideal, specially if I try to follow the ideas of the breakout game. Also, I was thinking of creating a wall with different sized rectangles, this can be done with a class, but I am trying to think how I can position them each time in a new configuration of different sized rectangles.
