### Midterm Project

The following markdown file hopes to explain the initial concept for my Midterm Project, in addition discuss the riskiest or most complicated element in the program.

#### Concept of the project

My initial idea for the project is to do the Breakout Atari game. This classic game main objective is to break a wall of bricks with a ball and paddle. However, I was planning to add some changes to the game, in this case primarily the brick wall with have bricks with different values (needs more hits to be destroyed) and falling objects that need to be avoided by the user while playing the game. 


#### Most complicated element

I believe that the most complicated element for now is getting right the collisions. We had seen an example in class of how to do a bouncing ball on the edges of the canvas. However, this now needs to be applied to objects within the canvas, in this case the bricks and the paddle. 


#### Sketches of concept:


#### First Update: Bricks, Paddle Movement and Bouncing Ball

For the first part, I worked on creating the brick wall with classes and random colors. Fortunately, I had done this task before for my Generative Art Assignment with Classes. So I reused code blocks from there, but this time rearranged the way the rectangles were displayed on screen.

After that I created the paddle 

#### Second Update: Collision with Paddle and Bricks


#### Third Update: Display Score and Manage Brick Points
